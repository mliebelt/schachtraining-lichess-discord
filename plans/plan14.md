# Plan for Communication Documentation Restructuring

**GitHub Issue:** #14
**Date:** 2026-02-21

## Context

The project originally focused on Discord as the primary communication tool for online chess training. Over time, the training has evolved to use multiple communication platforms:
- **Jitsi** (currently primary, as mentioned in intro.md)
- **Discord** (original tool, comprehensive docs already exist)
- **Teams** (mentioned as an option)
- **Zoom** (mentioned as an option)

The current `docs/discord.md` is outdated as it only covers one tool. The documentation in `docs/intro.md` mentions the switch to Jitsi but doesn't provide a comprehensive reference. This plan restructures the documentation to create a unified "Communication" chapter with sub-chapters for each tool.

## Proposed Structure

### New Chapter Name
**Folder:** `communication/`
**Category Label:** "Kommunikation im Training" (Communication during Training)
**Sidebar Position:** 3 (replacing current discord.md position)

### Directory Structure (Before → After)

**Before:**
```
docs/
├── intro.md                 (sidebar_position: 1)
├── lichess.md               (sidebar_position: 2)
├── discord.md               (sidebar_position: 3) ← standalone file
├── training.md
├── uebungen.md              (sidebar_position: 5)
└── Workshops/
```

**After:**
```
docs/
├── intro.md                 (sidebar_position: 1)
├── lichess.md               (sidebar_position: 2)
├── communication/           (sidebar_position: 3) ← new category
│   ├── _category_.json      ← category configuration
│   ├── discord.md           (sidebar_position: 1) ← moved and adapted
│   ├── jitsi.md             (sidebar_position: 2) ← new
│   ├── teams.md             (sidebar_position: 3) ← new
│   └── zoom.md              (sidebar_position: 4) ← new
├── training.md
├── uebungen.md              (sidebar_position: 5)
└── Workshops/
```

## Implementation Status

✅ **Phase 1: Create Communication Directory Structure** - COMPLETED
- Created `docs/communication/` directory
- Created `_category_.json` with proper configuration

✅ **Phase 2: Move and Adapt Discord Documentation** - COMPLETED
- Moved `docs/discord.md` to `docs/communication/discord.md`
- Updated frontmatter (sidebar_position: 1, title: "Discord")
- Fixed all image paths from `bilder/` to `../bilder/`

✅ **Phase 3: Create Jitsi Documentation** - COMPLETED
- Created comprehensive `docs/communication/jitsi.md`
- Extracted content from intro.md
- Added detailed sections on usage, troubleshooting, and hardware requirements

✅ **Phase 4: Create Teams Documentation** - COMPLETED
- Created `docs/communication/teams.md` with basic structure
- Documented Teams features, installation, and usage
- Noted that content will be expanded based on future usage

✅ **Phase 5: Create Zoom Documentation** - COMPLETED
- Created `docs/communication/zoom.md` with comprehensive structure
- Documented Zoom features, including breakout rooms and limitations
- Added comparison table with other communication tools

✅ **Phase 6: Update References in Other Documents** - COMPLETED
- Updated intro.md to reference new communication chapter
- Simplified Jitsi sections in intro.md with links to detailed pages
- Updated all workshop files (ws2411.md, ws2503.md, ws2405.md, ws2304.md, ws2206.md)
- Changed references from `/docs/discord.md` to `/docs/communication/discord`

## Files Created

1. `docs/communication/_category_.json` - Category configuration
2. `docs/communication/jitsi.md` - Jitsi documentation (comprehensive)
3. `docs/communication/teams.md` - Teams documentation (basic structure)
4. `docs/communication/zoom.md` - Zoom documentation (comprehensive)
5. `plans/plan14.md` - This plan file

## Files Modified

1. `docs/discord.md` → `docs/communication/discord.md` (moved, frontmatter updated, image paths fixed)
2. `docs/intro.md` (simplified, added references to communication chapter)
3. `docs/Workshops/ws2411.md` (updated Discord links)
4. `docs/Workshops/ws2503.md` (updated Discord links)
5. `docs/Workshops/ws2405.md` (updated Discord links)
6. `docs/Workshops/ws2304.md` (updated Discord links)
7. `docs/Workshops/ws2206.md` (updated Discord links)

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Verify build and functionality (Task #8 pending)
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure no errors
   - Run `npm start` to verify sidebar structure
   - Check that all links work correctly
   - Verify images display properly

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Sidebar shows "Kommunikation im Training" category at position 3
- ✅ Discord documentation is preserved with all content and images
- ✅ Jitsi documentation provides practical reference for current usage
- ✅ Teams and Zoom have basic structure for future expansion
- ✅ All internal links updated correctly
- ⏳ Local and production builds succeed (pending verification)
- ✅ intro.md is simplified with proper references to communication chapter

## Notes

- The autogenerated sidebar configuration means no changes needed to `sidebars.js`
- Docusaurus automatically generates category navigation from `_category_.json`
- Image paths use relative references (`../bilder/`) which work from communication subdirectory
- Discord.md serves as the most comprehensive reference
- Jitsi has medium detail as the current primary tool
- Teams and Zoom start minimal but have structure for expansion
- This aligns documentation with actual current usage (Jitsi primary, Discord reference, others occasional)
